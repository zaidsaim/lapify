<p>Warranty is limited to the parts and/or service(s) that were paid for. If only parts were purchased, <br/>warranty is limited to the replacement of the parts. If parts and repair service were purchased, <br/>warranty extends to cover the labor cost of part replacement and any other repairs specifically resulting from the initial repair.</p>
            <h5> The warranty is not applicable under the following scenarios :</h5>
<p>1. We do not cover any kind of accidental damage and our warranty stands null and void in all such related cases. <br/>Direct damage or damages caused as a consequence of accidents will not be covered under the 6 month warranty.<br/>
2. Any display issues that may arise without any manual intervention and are related to the screen quality <br/>specifically visible lines and blank screen<br/>
3. Excessive Damage to the device wherein there is a possibility that internal components might have been<br/> affected due to excessive or critical damage to the device or screen. Such excessive visible damage might lead <br/>to internal components getting damaged and can cause screen or other system malfunctions. Any part <br/>replacement wherein such damage is reported at the time of order completion will not be covered under the <br/>warranty provided. Such malfunctions can even become visible after immediately opening of the device and <br/>reassembly as any component damage/malfunction would become visible after opening the device and<br/> reassembly, Cashify Repair or any of its representative will neither be responsible nor liable for such issues.<br/>
4. Subsequent mishandling which causes the frame to bend, twist, or crack will not be entertained<br/>

13. Any loss of data occurring as a result of the repair â€“ customers are advised to back up all data prior to the repair attempt</p>
            <h5> Our warranty also does not cover the outcome of a repair<br/> if certain pre-repair conditions exist, including:</h5>
<p>1. Existence of known manufacturing and/or performance issues related to the device separate from repair, as noted prior to the repair<br/>
2. Existence of damage to the device frame, as noted prior to the repair<br/>
3. Water damage<br/>
4. Jail-broken devices<br/>
5. Tampering with internal hardware: Under certain conditions, internal damage may make a repair impossible.<br/> Our specialist will be able to explain in detail upon diagnosing your specific device. <br/>If you have any doubts, we recommend that you do not attempt to repair the device on your own, <br/>as any damage may affect the reparability of your device.</p>
